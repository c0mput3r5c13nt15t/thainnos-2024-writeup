# Ascending Security Level – Solution

Sort the algorithms by their security level.

```plaintext
NIST-P192	U
RSA-2048	N – 112-bit of security
AES-128	D – 128-bit of security
DH-4096	E - 192
SHA3-384	T - 192
Curve448-Goldilocks	I – 224 bits of security
RSA-8192	A – 200
AES-256	L – 256-bit of security
```

Reading the letters from top to bottom gives the flag text.
