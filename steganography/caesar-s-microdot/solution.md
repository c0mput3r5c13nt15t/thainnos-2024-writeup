# Caesar's Microdot â€“ Solution

Since microdot refers to a small piece of paper with a microphotograph on it, we can assume that the flag is hidden in the form of a small image in the pdf. We can extract all the images using:

```bash
pdfimages -all Caesar.pdf images
```

This gives us the following images:

![images-000.png](images-000.png)

![images-001.png](images-001.png)

![images-002.png](images-002.png)

![images-003.png](images-003.png)

![images-004.png](images-004.png)

The last image looks promising. Since the pdf is about Caesar, we can assume that the flag is hidden using the Caesar cipher. We can decrypt it using a shift of 3, which gives us the text inside the flag.
