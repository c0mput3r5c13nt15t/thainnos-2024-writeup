# RS-274 â€“ Solution

The title of the file guives us a hint that the content is base64 encoded. Decoding it gives us the following.

```gcode
G94     ( Inches per minute feed rate. )
G20     ( Units == INCHES.             )

The resulting text is gcode which when run (in a [simulator](https://ncviewer.com/)) shows two pcb boards, one of which shows the flag.
